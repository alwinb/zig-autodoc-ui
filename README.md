Zig Autodoc Frontend
====================

This project contains a modified version of the documentation and the documentation
browser (html page) that are distributed with the Zig compiler.

I have cleaned up the layout, but have also been studying and heavily refactoring the
javascript code, most of all as a way to learn the Zig language and its standard library
much better.

* You can try my version online [here][alwinb-autodoc-ui].
